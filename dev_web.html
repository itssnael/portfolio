                        <h3>About the project</h3>
                        <p>For this group project, my team designed a communication campaign commissioned by the European
Commission to raise awareness among young adults about the issue of residual waste. The goal was
to increase awareness and encourage the target audience to adopt more eco-friendly behaviors.</p>
                        <h3>The Process</h3>
                        <p>In this project, my role was to manage communication and content writing, create social media posts,
and handle the legal dossier and regulatory framework of the campaign. I also designed the <a href="https://www.figma.com/design/Qc2RTjc0LjQ7fFV71qH93S/Sina%C3%AF-maquette?node-id=0-1&t=HaFZl4rmYBBSs2LL-1" target="_blank">website mockup</a> using Figma.</p>

                        <h3>About the project</h3>
                        <p>This project is a game developed on Unity that puts into practice collision management
and interactions with buttons. The player explores a castle and must collect three flames,
which appear successively by triggering sounds and visual effects. The game consists of
three stages: a start screen with a launch button, the gameplay phase in FPS, and an
end screen.</p>
                        <h3>The Process</h3>
                        <p>I chose to create
a Survival Horror game with an Halloween theme. The story follows a father
trying to find his daughter, kidnapped by the Pumpkin Killer on Halloween night.</p>

                        <h3>About the project</h3>
                        <p>For this web integration project, I developed an interactive one-page website
using Ajax to enable dynamic image filtering based on several criteria. The goal
was to create a smooth and ergonomic interface, highlighting original objects
or services.</p>
                        <h3>The Process</h3>
                        <p>I developed a one-page website about exotic flowers, integrating Ajax filtering
by habitat and usage. The site uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript (jQuery, Ajax),
PHP, and a database I created to dynamically display and sort data. I also
integrated an interactive SVG map that allows users to filter flowers by their
geographical area.</p>
