                        <h3>About the project</h3>
                        <p>This project was carried out during my first-year MMI internship at LIFE TV under
the supervision and guidance of my internship mentor. The objective was to create a
poster inspired by one or more existing posters, analyzing their design process and
adapting them to my own style. I also had to adapt the poster into an Instagram story
and a Facebook post.</p>
                        <h3>The Process</h3>
                        <p>I decided to create a concert poster for the artist Tyla. I first selected a photo of Tyla
and cut it out using Photoshop. Then, I chose the colors, a pattern, fonts, and created
elements in Illustrator to design my poster. Finally, I adapted my visual to different
formats for social media.</p>

                        <p>This project is a brand guide based on the theme of Old Hollywood for the design
of Vanier College’s 2025 Yearbook.</p>
                        <h3>The Process</h3>
                        <p>My team and I first defined the theme and style we wanted for our concept, then
created a mood board. Next, we selected the colors and typography for our
designs before assembling the elements to create the layout for the student profile
pages in the Yearbook.</p>

                        <h3>About the project</h3>
                        <p>This project is a graphic book inspired by the South Korean artist So Youn Lee,
showcasing writing exercises completed as part of my MMI studies.</p>
                        <h3>The Process</h3>
                        <p>To achieve this, I first selected the artist who inspired me the most, as well as the
texts I wanted to illustrate. I then analyzed So Youn Lee’s works to determine
how to incorporate her graphic elements into my project. Finally, I designed and
created <a href="bookv4.pdf" target="_blank">this book</a> in InDesign.</p>

                        <p>This project is a visual identity creation. I designed RAGE, an innovative brand aiming to establish itself
in the boxing equipment market.</p>
                        <h3>The Process</h3>
                        <p>To achieve this, I first defined my brand’s activity, analyzed competitors, and determined its philosophy.
Then, from the original photo, I hand-drew four variations of the tiger’s head, scanned the final sketch, and vectorized it using
Illustrator. Once this step was completed, I selected a typography for the logo, tested several options,
and finalized the vectorization.</p>

                        <p>These creations are the result of 3D projects carried out in Blender to familiarize myself with the tool.

I created a perfume packshot for which I wanted to create an intriguing, yet bewitching and sensual atmosphere, like the scent of a flower. I played with colors and lighting to achieve this effect.

I also modeled a rocket to improve my skills with the various tools Blender offers.</p>
