                        <h3>About the project</h3>
                        <p>I took part in the production of a documentary titled <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x7B_jB276Sc9FnDxxGi8UIYuZJicCs8E/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">"Au-delà des silences"</a>,
which sheds light on the isolation of elderly people. I was part of the
audiovisual team, where I worked as an assistant director and assistant
editor. This short film was originally a final-year project by a group of
master’s students at UVSQ.</p>
                        <h3>The Process</h3>
                        <p>In this project, my role involved preparing interviews and planned scenes,
as well as coordinating the technical teams. I was also responsible for
sorting and organizing the raw footage to facilitate the editing process.</p>

                        <h3>About the project</h3>
                        <p>I participated in the creation of a web documentary on OSINT (Open Source Intelligence)
and its impact on the fight against disinformation. Through videos, articles, and a website,
the project demonstrates how OSINT helps journalists and citizens verify information they
find on the internet and separate fact from fiction.</p>
                        <h3>The Process</h3>
                        <p>For this project, I created a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WHiw64A-eSbWfSR7hlbvPJTJFqDs_oJZ/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank"> motion design in After Effects to introduce OSINT.</a> I started
by researching this technology to structure the script and narrative flow of the video. Then,
I created a storyboard to organize the different shots. Finally, I produced the video using
After Effects.</p>

                        <p>As part of an academic project, I was tasked with stepping into the shoes of a journalist to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C77mjfKoDZQ">interview Jean-Marie Lavallé,</a>  composer and creator of the <a href="https://interactivemusic.art/a-propos/">YIM machine,</a> YIM machine, in order to produce his EPK (electronic press kits). <br><br>
                           This shoot allowed me to experience audiovisual production from the front of the camera rather than behind it, which was a completely new perspective for me. Trying my hand at journalism was a first for me, and I loved the experience.</p>
